Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. 

Again, I was combating the notion that it was a """"absurd part"""" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do. At the end of the day, it is a value judgment (as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread), not a scientific judgement. If we choose to make this value judgment in the article, it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 2005 DNA study by Hammer
 Describes the Yayoi migration from Korea based on the O-SRY(465) genes and other genes with close lineage (haplogroups O-M122 and O-M95).
Reiterates that """"the entire O haplogroup has been proposed to have a Southeast Asian origin.""""  (Their definition of Southeast Asia includes southern China).  Then hypothesizes that """"the dispersals of Neolithic farmers from Southeast Asia also brought haplogroup O lineages to Korea and eventually to Japan.""""
 In the concluding paragraph, it states """"we propose that the Yayoi Y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern Asia, perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region.""""
 Hammer's DNA study is based on a """"global sample consisted of > 2,500 males from 39 Asian populations, including six populations sampled from across the Japanese archipelago.""""

As for your claims of """"stalking"""", that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation. I have assumed good faith (and good intentions) on your part, and have never suggested (or seen reason to suggest) that you might have some ulterior motive in mass-adding links to one specific company's web page. Nor, for that matter, have I ever made any suggestion that this is an """"administrative"""" matter or even mentioned such a role. (Clearly, as a party to this disagreement, I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest.)

"001d874a4d3e8813","""::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims """"despite """"Third Way"""" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force""""? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a """"Third Way"""" as the references show.

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to """"cover up"""" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -
